	3. has never been observed, though it would be really cool if one could
	4. can be formed with paired fermions so long as the pairs have integer spin values
	5. forms the same way as a phase transition: it is due to increased interactions between bosons
68. Imagine you have a very large number of available states that can be  populated at a given temperature. Imagine also that the density of  particles is low.  Among the assertions below, which one is  **not true** (please read the question carefully -- Choice: each word counts) ?
	1. The system has a small chemical potential, compared to the typical  energy involved here
	2. The system can be described by Boltzmann distribution in pretty good  approximation.
	3. Since the density of particles is small and the number of states is large,  it is unlikely that a given state is doubly occupied and we do not have to worry about state indistinguishability or symmetry of the wave functions too much. 
	4. All the other assertions are true.
69. In the screencast we derived an expression for the Fermi-Dirac distribution  using the grand canonical ensemble. What is the grand canonical ensemble?
	1. The ensemble of systems with fixed energy and entropy.
	2. The ensemble of systems with fixed energy and chemical potential.
	3. The ensemble of systems with fixed temperature and chemical potential.
70. Is it possible to derive an expression of the Fermi-Dirac distribution using the microcanonical ensemble (fixed temperature and number of particles)?
	1. Yes, we calculate the number of microstates and maximimze the entropy under constraints using Lagrange multipliers.
	2. Yes, we sum all the Boltzmann factors and integrate over the energy.
	3. No, Fermi-Dirac applies to fermions, which require the chemical potential to be constant.
	4. No, otherwise we would have done it in the screencast or during the weekly problem solving session. 
71. The Fermi energy (select the most accurate answer)...
	1. coincides with the chemical potential at zero temperature
	2. marks the highest occupied energy state of a Fermionic system at a  given temperature
	3. the other two answers are correct
72. This fall, I enjoyed Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics...
	1. A lot
	2. Very much
	3. Of course
	4. Certainly :math:`\bra{\psi}` is definitely not the same as :math:`\ket{\phi}`
